# Val2022

This tool downloads the Swedish election result 2022 from
the Swedish election authority (Valmyndigheten) using best
practice methods to limit bandwith usage. The downloading
code is relatively stable.

The tool also includes a highly customized ad-hoc output of 
some aggregated voting data including the preliminary seat 
count for the national parliament during the counting process.

When run from the command-line there are various switches
for modifying data source and aggregation rules.
